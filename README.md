Serial Studio is a simple, multi-platform, and multi-purpose data visualization program that allows embedded developers to visualize, analyze, and represent data generated from their projects and devices. It does not require the need to write project-specific visualization software.

Over my many CanSat-based competitions, I found myself writing and maintaing several Ground Station Softwares for each program. However, I decided that it would be easier and more sustainable to define one flexible Ground Station Software that let developers define how each CanSat presents data using an extensible communication protocol for easy data visualization. Developers can also use Serial Studio for almost any data acquisition and visualization project outside of CanSat, now supporting data retrieval from a hardware serial ports, software serial ports, MQTT, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and network sockets (TCP/UDP).

## Install

You can [download](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/latest) and install Serial Studio for your preferred platform.

GNU/Linux users must enable the `executable` flag before attempting to run the application:

```bash
chmod +x SerialStudio-1.1.1-Linux.AppImage
./SerialStudio-1.1.1-Linux.AppImage
```

You can also use the [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher/) to integrate Serial Studio with your system.

### Prebuilt Linux packages

Arch Linux users can install [serial-studio-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/serial-studio-git/) from the aur, e.g. with [aurutils](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurutils/):

```bash
aur fetch serial-studio-git
aur build
sudo pacman -S serial-studio-git
```

## Licence

This project is released under the MIT license, for more information, check the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file.

## Development

### Requirements

The only requirement to compile the application is to have [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) installed in your system. The desktop application will compile with **Qt 6.3.2**.

On GNU/Linux systems, you will also need to install `libgl1-mesa-dev` in order to compile the application.

Full list of used Qt modules:

- Qt SVG
- Qt Quick
- Qt Widgets
- Qt Networking
- Qt Serial Port
- Qt Print Support
- Qt Quick Widgets
- Qt Quick Controls 2

### Cloning

This repository makes use of [`git submodule`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). In order to clone it, execute these commands on your Terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio
	cd Serial-Studio
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Alternatively, just run:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio

### Compiling the application

Once you have Qt installed, open *Serial-Studio.pro* in Qt Creator and click the "Run" button.

Alternatively, you can also use the following commands:

	qmake
	make -j4
